				<h1 id=storytitle >OREdornment</h1>
				<p id=story >We are an aunt and niece team of jewelry designers located in the Greater Philadelphia area. 
				Several years ago we became interested in jewelry design and started experimenting with techniques
				and attending workshops. When our passion for the craft grew beyond a hobby we decided to start OREdornment. 
				Since 2013 we have been providing unique, handmade jewelry to our customers. Most of our pieces
				are one-of-a-kind and all are made with our personal attention to quality. We specialize in bead stitching, 
				wire work, and metal stamping.We can also work with you to create custom pieces for your wedding
				or other special occaision. If you see something here that you like or are interested in a consultation, 
                just send a message to www.OREdornment@gmail.com. We hope to hear from you soon!</p>
